# ElectricitySupply

This is a University project on Java class.
Our team includes me and my two teammates studied about AI algorithm and its application.
About our project, based on the alternate version of Knapsack Problem, we researched about the solution on problem of Electricity Supply, as whether we could maximize the amount of electric, while minimize the cost to the environment.
Our solution is to modify Genetic Algorithm, to give our best compared result to brute-force.
We used Java FX 11 to code the based, the IDE to execute program is IntelliJ, with the help from Framework Scene Builder 2.0.
